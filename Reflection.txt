What did you learn about Git or GitHub?

What I earned about Git/GitHub is that it is a way to collaborate on projects. It allows for version control which allows you to keep track of everything that changed between the versions. These are great ways to manage your project when working in a large team. This can also help keep work organized and stramline the progress of the project by having teams work on different aspects.
